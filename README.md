# 🧠 ZHAW Survival Scripts

*May these scripts guide you through the dark tunnels of academia*

## 📚 What is this?

This repository contains a collection of scripts I wrote during my studies at **ZHAW CT2** cuz I understood shit :).  
They cover various topics relevant for exams – and possibly mental breakdowns.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- I’m not saying these scripts are perfect.
- I’m not saying they will guarantee you a 6.
- I'm not even sure if they are uptodate anymore
- But I *am* saying they helped me survive, and maybe they’ll help you too.
- Also: **Don’t just learn them blindly – understand the code and make changes if needed!**

## 🛠 Topics included

- [x] Panic-fueled last-minute scripts
- [x] Hopefully correct logic
- [x] Rare but satisfying `// it just works`
- [x] That one thing the professor said *"won’t be in the exam"* but you know it will be

## ⭐ How to support

If these scripts save your day, your grade, or your academic soul –  
please consider dropping a ⭐ on this repo.  
It helps my fragile ego and keeps the motivation alive for future updates. 🙃

## 🐍 Requirements

Depending on the scripts, you might need:

- Python 3.x
- A will to live (optional but recommended)

Created with pain, hope by **Landrit**.  
If you spot mistakes, feel free to open an issue or a PR – or just cry silently like I did when writing them.
